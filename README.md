## About
This website was created as a place for craft beer lovers to learn about and share their experiences on new beers and breweries around the country. I haven't found a similar Irish site that offers reviews on new beers, which are being released in large quantities.  <br>

## User Experience

### User Stories
- #### As a general user;
    1. I want to read about new beers on the market.
    2. I want to see the top rated beers. 
    3. I want to see which breweries are releaseing new beers.
    4. I want to see a list of breweries around the country
    5. I want to be able to search for specific beers by style/brewery.

- #### As a brewer who works in a brewery
    1. I want to know what are the top rated beers.
    2. I want to see real time data on how people are feeling about mine and my competitors products.
   


### Design

    - The design aspect of this project was something (among many others) that I wish I had more time to work on. I used the banner image of hops to display on each page, but didn't have time to add much more in terms of design.
 

- #### Typography
    - The Fonts used on the site are Oibee Sans and Six caps. For headers and beer names on review cards I wanted a sharp and hip font to catch the users eye and make them feel like they are on a fun and engaging website that isn't too serious
    <br>
  

- #### Wireframes/Mockups
    - I had an image in my head of how I wanted the site to look, as I had used a bootstrap template. This image never came to fruition.
